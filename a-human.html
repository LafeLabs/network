    edit this HTML file, changing the content to be appropriate for whateer page you are trying to create.
    
    
    the prompts in the file a-human.html are meant to help you figure out what you want to share with the network.  
    
    The four main types of HTML you want to know about are:
    
    p = "paragraph"
    a = "anchor", or links
    h1 = "heading"
    img = "image"
    
    each type of thing is in a angle brackets like this: <p>  and ends with a forward slash like this: </p>
    
    HTML ignores paragraph breaks unless you put your text between "<p>" tags.  
    
    The trash magic javascript code at the bottom of this file will turn all your links into rainbow trash magic links and all your headings into rainbow trash magic headings. This process uses the JavaScript library trashmagic.js
    
    The carboard brown background and general trash magic layout is in the style file trashmagic.css. 
    
    
    
    follow the prompts to join a trash magic network.  Find an instance where your are in community with people and make a page.  This is a mutual aid network, we all ask for support from the network and all offer what we can to the network.  This is also a media network.  We use it to share whatever other media we create, including whatever is on all the commercial social media platforms we use.  
    
    Once you know how to create pages and add to them, you can add trash magic products to the products page, add places to the watershed and street networks, add links to local resources in the community resrouces page, and make personal pages for people in your social network who don't want to interact with the code.
