At Upcycle Robotics we believe in building a whole new civilization from trash and only trash.  To do this we have formed the Trash Magic Network.  This is made of teams of people who replicate technology made from trash, starting with robots made of trash which print on trash.  We need ***makers*** to build robots, ***sponsors*** to support both materials and other creators' time, ***artists*** to create symbolic languages for the robots to print on the trash, and ***operators*** to run robots out in public and share the trash magic media with the world.
