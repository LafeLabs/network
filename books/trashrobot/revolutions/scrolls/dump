# The Magic dump
 
The Magic Dump is an unenclosed digital commons.  It is the set of all machines which trash magicians have purged from the private property system and made into really really free servers. We put these servers onto networks, and share those networks as freely as we can.  For now, we use the commercial Internet but as [NicoNet](scrolls/niconet) grows we will more and more spread the elements of the Magic Dump on those free wireless networks.
