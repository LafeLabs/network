We will use the [Street Network](scrolls/street) and the  [Watershed Network](scrolls/wastershed) to find waste streams, find places where we can work freely, and find people who have skills and time. People will go to places, and accept waste streams to make products, which we then go out and distribute using the [Trash Carts](scrolls/trashcarts) in the Street and Watershed Networks.
