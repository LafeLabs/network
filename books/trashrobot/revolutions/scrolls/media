# media
 
We must become the media.  We take in trash and remove all private or personal data.  We turn it into free media.

Free like goose guano in a park.
Free like the free box in a punk house.
Free like an unlocked dumpster. 
Free like a pile of tires you find in the woods.
Free like food not bombs.
Free like a piece of driftwood with a nail in it.

And then we put free software on it. And free self-replicating documents which use the digital elements of trash magic.  This includes the Trash Magic JavaScript library, the Trash Magic CSS framework, the Trash Magic code editor, the Trash Magic code replicator, and various other elements which together make up what we call "cybermagic".  

This system then supports media of ALL kinds shared over the open web.  This stats with simple trash magic web pages and ebooks like this one, but also includes music, videos, pdfs, images, and any other media people might want to share freely in an unenclosed digital commons.
