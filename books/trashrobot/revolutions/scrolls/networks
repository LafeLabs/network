# Networks
 
Revolutionary power comes from the ability to create, maintain, evolve and replicate networks.  This work is based on that idea.  It is an exposition of how a network of networks can be built which can consume the existing extractive economic and political systems by out-replicating them in a sustainable way.  

The networks which dominate our lives are based on violence and extraction. The twin pillars of power in our world are the nation state and the corporation.  Both are based on constant extraction and violence.

 This document is itself a network of documents.  And it is built to replicate across the Open Web, which is itself a network of networks of documents.  

We will describe a set of networks in this work and say a few words about how to build those networks.  Then we will find people to build the networks and we will co-create the evolution of this document as we expand and evolve it all.  

We aim not to build great things but to build things which have the innate tendency to evolve into great things.  We are building systems which amplify structures, and then injecting structures into those amplifiers which can project to the large scale changes we wish to see.


This document is a creation of the practice of revolutionary magic.
