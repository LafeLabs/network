# soil: the internet of dirt
 
This begins with the Geometron Hypercube and other trash-sourced containers for growing. Buckets. Boxes. Totes. Shopping carts. Steel drums.  All of these things will become  the Internet of Dirt.

We will get waste streams from local people and create compost which builds soil which goes into this internet of dirt.  We will move it around with shopping carts from the trash.
