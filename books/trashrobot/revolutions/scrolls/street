The Street network is a mutual aid network which spans the streets of the world.  People with resources in a fixed location will provide resources for the people on the road.  People on the road will distribute resources to people on the street. Everyone distributes the memes which replicate the network.  People across the world who support the mission can pay in the consumer economy for resources to go to network stations, which distribute out to the rest of the network.

We will place physical media in shared spaces along the streets of the world which point back to online trash magic which media which then adds layers of meaning and connection to the physical street. 

We engage with the streets using the methods of psychogeography, creating the media needed to add layers of culture to the physical spaces of the city.

We will build NeoDenver.  NeoDenver is a city built in on and around the city of the old world known as "Denver".
