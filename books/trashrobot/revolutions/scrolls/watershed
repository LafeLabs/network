# watershed
 
This is the original Social Network. It is older than humanity. It is how the water gets from the sky to the sea.

We will build a social network along all of the waterways and then build out all the other networks on that.  Slowly but surely we will move our energy and attention from the Street Network to the Watershed Network.
