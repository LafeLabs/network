# webservers not bombs
 
Americans throw away 40 million computers a year, along with vast streams of other network-enabled hardware.  We must seize these streams, destroy all the private data on them, put liberated software systems on them, and then turn them into servers dispensing documents outside of the private property system.

 
Webservers are "really really free".  They're free like food at food not bombs.  Free like the free box in a punk house. Free like an unlocked dumpster.  Free like goose guano in the park.
