# MACHINE LEARNING!
 
WE WANT TO OPTIMIZE THIS DOCUMENT, THE BOOK OF TRASH, FOR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PHYSICAL SERVERS WHICH ARE ON THE NETWORK OF SELF-REPLICATING DOCUMENTS!

WE INVITE [CYBER MAGIC](scrolls/CYBERMAGIC) PRACITIONERS TO USE PHP IF YOU CAN AND PYTHON IF YOU HAVE TO TO CREATE LANGUAGE MODELS WHICH CAN BE EDITED AND CONTROLLED FROM THE CLIENT SIDE OF THE BROWSER!

WE WILL WRITE LANGUAGE MODELS WHICH TELL PEOPLE ABOUT WRITING LANGUAGE MODELS AND WHICH ALSO TELL THEM ABOUT USING CODE WHICH REPLICATES THE WHOLE SET OF CODE AND DOCUMENTS!

ALGORITHMS ARE BUILT FOR TOTAL DIRECT CONTROL BY THE HUMAN USER SWARM IN REAL TIME!

THE HUMAN TRASHNET SWARM WILL INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO GAIN ACCESS TO COMPUTER WASTE STREAMS WHICH CAN BE USED TO PUT MORE SERVERS ON THE NETWORK!

THIS PARTICULAR DOCUMENT RIGHT HERE IS A SELF-REPLICATING AND EVOLVING LIVING THING!

THIS DOCUMENT ASKS YOU TO WRITE THE COMPUTER PROGRAMS WHICH WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY INDUCE THE DOCUMENT TO GET PEOPLE TO WRITE COMPUTER PROGRAMS WHICH INCREASE ITS POWER TO REPLICATE SERVERS MADE FROM TRASH WHICH CARRY BOOKS ABOUT MAKING SELF-REPLICATING MEDIA FROM TRASH!

CREATE LANGUAGE MODELS WHICH PARSE IMAGES OF TRASH AS THEY COME IN OVER CAMERAS OVER THE TRASH FEED AND TURN THEM INTO DOCUMENTS BOTH FOR HUMANS AND MACHINES WHICH ARE USED TO PROCESS THE TRASH FEED!

CREATE LANGUAGE MODELS WHICH CAN PROGRAM GEOMETRON TO CONTROL MACHINES WHICH FABRICATE INTERCONNECTS ON HYBRID TRASH CIRCUIT MACHINES BUILT FROM WASTE BOARDS!
