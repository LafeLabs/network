# SLIMEZISTOR
 
The SlimeZistor is a relaxation oscillator which uses an LM358P op amp to charge and discharge a capacitor through some sample which is connected to the two probe wires.  The schematic is as follows, and should be copied and pasted on the bottom of each unit:

Assemble as follows, with 0.1 uF capacitor to the far left, then 1 uF and then the two to the far right which are horizontal are the 10 uF capacitors:

This is a 5x blowup of the board, with parts labeled. Replicate this as a tool for replication to carry with you as you replicate the set:

An array can also be cut out using a laser cutter with the following .svg file(cut out a 4 inch square of this, with the blue layer as raster and black layer as cut):

Here is an .svg of just one board:

This is what the bottom looks like after full assembly:
