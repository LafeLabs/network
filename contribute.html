    <h1>How to contribute to the trash magic network</h1>


    <p>
        1. Create Physical Post:Write the web address of a trash magic page on a piece of trash and put it in a shared public space.  
    </p>
    

    <p>
        2. Contribute a link to the "resources" page by going to the web code editor and clicking on the file "resources.html" in the lower right corner of the screen.  Copy/paste an existing link to a resource, then change the link and the text for the resource you want to add.
    </p>    


    <p>3. create a personal home page as a participant in the network and link to it from the people page.</p>
    
    <p>4. Add something you make to the trash magic products.  To do this, create a new page for the thing you make from trash or easily donated materials, and then link to the new page from the trash magic products page at "products.html".  This combines the skill of making a new page with the skill of making a link to a page.</p>
