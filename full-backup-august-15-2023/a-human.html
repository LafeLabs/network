    edit this HTML file, changing the content to be appropriate for whateer page you are trying to create.
    
    
    the prompts in the file a-human.html are meant to help you figure out what you want to share with the network.  
    
    The four main types of HTML you want to know about are:
    
    p = "paragraph"
    a = "anchor", or links
    h1 = "heading"
    img = "image"
    
    each type of thing is in a angle brackets like this: <p>  and ends with a forward slash like this: </p>
    
    HTML ignores paragraph breaks unless you put your text between "<p>" tags.  
    
    The trash magic javascript code at the bottom of this file will turn all your links into rainbow trash magic links and all your headings into rainbow trash magic headings. This process uses the JavaScript library trashmagic.js
    
    The carboard brown background and general trash magic layout is in the style file trashmagic.css. 
    
    Perhaps the three most useful resources online for learning about web development are the tutorials at www.w3schools.com, the reference material at https://developer.mozilla.org/, and the community examples at codepen.io.
    
    follow the prompts to join a trash magic network.  Find an instance where your are in community with people and make a page.  This is a mutual aid network, we all ask for support from the network and all offer what we can to the network.  This is also a media network.  We use it to share whatever other media we create, including whatever is on all the commercial social media platforms we use.  
    
    Once you know how to create pages and add to them, you can add trash magic products to the products page, add places to the watershed and street networks, add links to local resources in the community resrouces page, and make personal pages for people in your social network who don't want to interact with the code.
    
    
    Whenever you make a new page, copy/paste the text of the code somewhere so that you can replicate it and bring it back if it's deleted from any given instance.  Tell operators of trash magic instances about pages you make so they can help replicate them by putting them in the self-replicating sets which spread pages from server to server.

    Who are you and how did you learn about Trash Magic?  
</p>

<p>
What kind of  art/craft/making things do you do? This is broad, and can include cooking, writing, music, graphic arts, digital arts, textile crafts, building science things, growing plants and animals and fungi, really anything where you create something of any kind.
</p>

<p>
    what skills or knowledge do you want to teach people in the network to help spread trash magic?  gardening? composting? code?  mathematics? philosophy? sports?  art?  cooking?  aquaculture?  
</p>

<p>
What city or town are you closest to?  What are some public shared spaces(libraries, coffee shops, parks, maker spaces, art spaces, bookstores, etc.) where you can get access to and share trash magic?
</p>

<p>
What watershed are you in? What is the main body of flowing water where you are?  
</p>

<p>
    what is the best way for people to contact you?
    </p>
<p>

    Who do you want to be talking to more, who should reach out to you?
    
</p>


<p>
    what trash magic products might you be interested in creating and sharing?
</p>

<p>
    how can people materially support you in your creating?  What resources do you need or want?  what are you selling that people can buy?  what resources are you needing to surive right now?
</p>

<p>

How can you contribute to the network? some examples include:

    write the domain of your instance and information on how to find your page on some kind of trash and place it in a place that is on the network.  Build the physical network with physical media of this kind, linking physical spaces to online spaces. 

just tell people about trash magic and get excited about it and be part of the community(if this is all, that's great!  we need supporters).

build mobile gardening projects in trash sourced containers and share them with the network

fix cars and trucks and vans(mechanical)

build and repair solar apparatus and other off grid infrastructure

provide a free meal or coffee for a trash magician

distirbute some kind of trash made art that you make using the network(it's ok to charge money for it as long as you are not keeping the way you make it a secret!)

medical help

let a trash magician stay at your place or camp on your land or work on your property on trash magic
