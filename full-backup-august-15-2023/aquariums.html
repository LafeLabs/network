    <h1>Aquariums</h1>

<p>
Aquariums!  They're great!  They can be used to build a whole civiliztion!  How do we get started?  How do we scale it all up?  How does this work inform the gardening and water handling work?  
</p>
<p>
How can aluminum cans and plastic bottles be used to aid aquarium technology constrution?  How can geometric structures built from trash containers grow and evolve in river systems into complex networks of water?  How can this system deal with flash floods?  How do we handle the cascade of this trash down the rivers? 
</p>
<p>
How are aquaculture ecosystems used to fight enemy insects and help friend insects?  How is aquaculture used in food production?  How is aquaculture used in medicine production?  
</p>
<p>
    how can flowing systems of water in trash be used for HVAC applications, for cooling?  
</p>
<p>
how will this evolve as coastal cities become innundated with flood water?  How can we build hybrid salt water and fresh water systems that manage storm surge, tidal surge and river outflow in these spaces?
