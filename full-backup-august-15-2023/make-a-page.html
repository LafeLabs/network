    <h1>Make a page!</h1>

<p>
Make your own web page to join the trash magic network!
</p>

<p>
    First click on a web editor using the link on this page.  Open that in another browser window so that you can go back and see these instrutions as you follow along.  You can do this by right clicking on the link instead of left clicking and selecting "open link in new window".  
</p>

<img alt = "screen shot showing that the link to lick is called web code editor" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/network/main/trashmagic/editor-screenshot-6.png"/>

<p>
    Then click on "a-human.html" to see a sample page for a person(as opposed to products and places.  Doing this will load the prototype into memory so that when you create a new page it will copy that prototype.
</p>

<img alt = "screen shot of code editor where to click on to select a file" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/network/main/trashmagic/editor-screenshot-1.png"/>

<p>
    Think of a name for your page which can be a web address, so no spaces or weird characters other than underscore, dash. This can be a handle you want to use on the network or just something easy to remember that connects to you or your work in some way.  It ALWAYS must end with ".html". So for example, if your name is CHAOS TOAD you might create CHAOS-TOAD.html.  Or chaos_toad.html or chaostoad.html. 
</p>

<img alt = "screen shot of code editor showing what it will look like after it loads" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/network/main/trashmagic/editor-screenshot-3.png"/>

<p>
    Go through the code and add anything you want to share with the network.  There are a random assortment of prompts in the code to guide you.  Read what is written in the comments in the code.  Make a page that says what you can share with the trash magic network and what support you want from the network.  
</p>


<img alt = "screen shot of code editor showing with a sample page loaded with writing prompts in the body" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/network/main/trashmagic/editor-screenshot-4.png"/>


<p>
    Once you have created your page, click on "people.html" to load that file and then copy/paste an existing link to a persons page and replace the text and link with your file and name as shown below.</p>

<p>
    Now tell people about it! Share the code!  Save the code! Replicate the code!  Send it to network operators who can help spread it in self-replicating sets of files via trash magic.  Build more servers, get more people involved in the network, link up with them and share resources and actions!
