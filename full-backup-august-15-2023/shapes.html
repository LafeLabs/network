    <h1>Action Geometry Shapes</h1>

<p>The shapes of Action Geometry can be laser cut out of acrylic, or for trash magic they can be cut out of thing cardboard like from a cereal box.  They are used to construct geometry on other trash as documented in the Books of Geometron(see free ebooks).</p>

<p>
    All the shapes are based on the unit of the "sexicubit", which is 1/6 of a 18 inch cubit, or 3 inches.  The shapes are designed to represent common symmetries and scales which exist in both the natural world and human technology.  The symmetries are 3 fold, four fold, five fold, and six fold symmetry.  The scales are 2, 3, square root of 2, square root of 3, and the Golden Ratio.  These shapes can be copied from existing ones, traced from the screen here, printed and copied, or constructed using tools of classical Geometry or found objects.
