    <h1>Golden Triangle</h1>

<p>
The Golden Triangle is one of the Shapes of Action Geometry which works well by itself. It is an isosceles triangle in which the duplicated side is in the golden ratio to the base side.  The Golden Ratio is the scale that is at the heart of all fivefold symmetry patterns which exist both in technology and in the natural world.  It is the ratio of the side of a regular pentagon to the distance between non-adjacent points on the pentagon.  When we construct anything with fivefold symmetry we see it repeated again and again.  
</p>

<p>
    Much mystical meaning has also been asigned to it over the centuries, but for our purposes, the fact that the Universe imposes this scale on fivefold symmetry is mystical enough!  There are so many both natural and human-built things with this symmetry that we see it again and again, and having a little triangle in our pockets made from trash which can reproduce all that is a great tool of trash magic!  To make one, copy the angles from a screen or print it out and then trace on some thin flat trash material, cut out, and then make a second one and use that to create fractal structures insid the main triagle as you see in the images below.
