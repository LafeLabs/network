# [Laws of the Network](https://github.com/LafeLabs/network/tree/main/laws)

1. Content creators receiver direct material support from their communities
2. No non-consensual media(no ads)
3. No algorithms, human operators curate media and connect people
4. Every server is a client, every client is a server
5. "Content" includes everything we need for a good life, including food, shelter, transport, medicine, communication, media, community, clean water, sanitation, and so on.
6. The creators of the network are just another type of content creator on the network, the network itself is content
7. No intellectual property of any kind exists on the network, and physical infrastructure exists outside of the system of private property, all servers are autonomous zones
8. Each server has off-grid power to run indefinitely outside
9. Each server contains the means of its own replication
10. Nodes can form scalable ad-hoc mesh networks with no central network(this is not the Internet)
