## Replication Discography:

Open a linux command line on your network server, go to whatever directory you want to put the music in and type these two commands to replicate the album:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/network/main/music/thelastpoet/copythelastpoet.sh
sh copythelastpoet.sh
```
Then create a link to "thelastpoet" on the music page and any other pages which should link here.
