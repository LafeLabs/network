# [TRASH MAGIC MIXTAPE!](https://www.github.com/lafelabs/mixtape)

MUSICIANS! FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THE OWNERS OF THE RECORDING AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS HAVE TOLD YOU THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS THE BEST WAY FOR YOU TO BENEFIT FROM YOUR MUSIC!  WE PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION OF MUSIC IN WHICH TRASH MAGIC OPERATORS USE DONATED COMPUTERS WHICH ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN TO DISTRIBUTE MUSIC FOR FREE.  WE PROPOSE THAT THE FANS OF MUSIC SUPPORT MUSICIANS NOT BY "BUYING" THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO MUSIC BUT BY DIRECTLY PROVIDING SUPPORT TO MUSICIANS AS ARTISTS, SUPPORTING THE PERSON NOT THE WORK. THIS HOLDS FOR THE NETWORK OPERATORS AS WELL. WE ASK FOR SUPPORT AS CREATORS OF THE NETWORK, BUT THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ARE BOTH IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN!  THIS IS A FULLY ANARCHO-COMMUNIST NETWORK IN WHICH THE PHYSICAL NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. WE ARE BUILDING THE ANARCHIST BELL SYSTEM!
        
        
WHAT WE ASK FOR FROM ARTISTS IS THAT YOU DONATE SONGS TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN SO THAT WE, THE TRASH MAGICIANS, CAN CREATE SELF-REPLICATING MIXTAPES WHICH USE THOSE SONGS!  SEND YOUR SONG OR A LINK TO YOUR SONG ALONG WITH A STATEMENT "I RELEASE THIS SONG INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN" TO THE OPERATOR AT OPERATOR@SLOANSLAKE.ART(REPLACE THIS WITH OTHER OPERATORS AS MORE OPERATORS JOIN THE NETWORK).  SEND AN ARTIST'S STATEMENT FOR YOUR GROUP OR YOURSELF ABOUT WHY AND HOW YOU MAKE ART.  SEND LINKS TO ALL YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA OR ANY OTHER CONTACT INFORMATION YOU WANT TO SHARE, LIKE EMAIL OR PHONE NUMBERS. SEND LINKS TO YOUR ACCOUNTS AT WHATEVER PAYMENT PLATFORM YOU HAVE LIKE CASHAPP VENMO, PAYPAL ETC. NO CRYPTO.  WE, THE OPERATORS, WILL MAKE YOU A TRASH MAGIC WEB PAGE WITH ALL YOUR INFORMATION AND THAT PAGE WILL SELF-REPLICATE AS PART OF THE SELF-REPLICATING MIXTAPE! 
        

ALSO SEND ANY OTHER ART YOU HAVE RELEVANT TO THE SONG AND ALSO A STATEMENT RELEASING THAT ART INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND IT WILL ALSO GET INTEGRATED INTO THE SELF-REPLICATING MIXTAPE AS PART OF YOUR TRASH MAGIC WEB PAGE!

    
TRASH MAGIC WILL BUILD A SYSTEM OF SELF-REPLICATING MEDIA MADE OF TRASH WHICH IS USED TO CREATE SELF-REPLICATING REPLICATION TECHNOLOGY FROM TRASH WHICH REPLCIATES ALL THE THINGS WE NEED FOR A GOOD LIFE FROM TRASH AND THINGS WE CAN GROW!  AT THIS PHASE OF TRASH MAGIC WE USUALLY USE THE CAPS LOCK ALL THE TIME AND USUALLY END ALL OUR SENTENCES WITH EXCLAMATION MARKS AND ALSO MAKE SENTENCES THAT ARE TOO LONG!  WE WILL MAKE BILLIONS OF 4 INCH CARDBOARD SQUARES AND USE THEM TO BUILD UP AN INTERNET OF TRASH!  THIS INTERNET OF TRASH WILL SPREAD THE LINKS TO PUBLIC DOMAIN SERVERS FROM TRASH WHICH HOST THE TRASH MAGIC DOCUMENTS!  THIS IS HYPERTRASH, A SYSTEM OF HYPERLINKED MEDIA WHICH IS ALL FROM TRASH!

EMAIL YOUR STUFF TO OPERATOR@SLOANSLAKE.ART

TRASH MAGIC MIX TAPE!  WE GET COMPUTERS FROM THE TRASH AND TURN THEM INTO SERVERS FOR LOCAL DISTRIBUTION OF MIXTAPES.  MIX TAPES ARE SELF-REPLICATING WEB PAGES WHICH CAN BE HOSTED ON ANY MACHINE: WINDOWS, MACOS, IOS, ANDROID, LINUX.  PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. ON THE INTERNET AND ON LOCAL WIFI NETWORKS.  EACH INSTANCE LINKS TO THE REST OF THE TRASH MAGIC NETWORK WHICH IS USED TO REPLICATE LINKS BACK TO THE MIX TAPES.  

### TRASH MAGIC SERVER

TO REPLICATE THE TRASH MAGIC SERVER, GET A COMPUTER FROM THE TRASH AND WIPE THE HARD DRIVE AND INSTALL [UBUNTU](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) OR SOME OTHER KIND OF LINUX.  THEN REPLICATE THE TRASH MAGIC SERVER BY INSTALLING [APACHE](https://www.apache.org/) AND [PHP](https://www.php.net/), COPYING AND RUNNING THE REPLICATOR SCRIPT [REPLICATOR.PHP](https://github.com/LafeLabs/mixtape/blob/main/replicator.php)!  

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm index.html
sudo apt install curl
sudo curl -o replicator.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/mixtape/main/php/replicator.txt
cd ..
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
cd html
php replicator.php
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
```

TO LINK FROM A PHYSICAL SPACE, USE A SELF-REPLICATING TRASH MAGIC MEDIA FORM LIKE:

 - [SQUARE](https://www.github.com/lafelabs/square)
 - [TRIANGLE](https://www.github.com/lafelabs/triangle)
 - [STICK](https://www.github.com/lafelabs/stick)

PUT A MIX TAPE ON A THUMB DRIVE AND REPLICATE IT FROM ONE WEB DIRECTORY ON ONE SERVER TO ANOTHER. FOR PRIVATE SERVERS IN PRIVATE SPACES, ON WINDOWS AND MAC, USE [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/).  PUT SONGS IN THE MIXTAPE FOLDER AND THEY SHOULD APPEAR IN THE MAIN HOME PAGE ON THE MIXTAPE SERVER!  

IF YOU USE XAMPP, YOU CAN FIND THE SONG FILES ON A PC AT c:\xampp\htdocs\mixtape AND SKINS AT c:\xampp\htdocs\skins.  

POINT A LINK FROM ANOTHER TRASH MAGIC SERVER TO A LOCAL IP ADDRESS OF WHATEVER SERVER IS DELIVERING THE MIXTAPE ON THE LOCAL WIFI NETWORK!  USE TRASH TO POINT TO THE TRASH MAGIC SERVER WHICH HAS A QUEST TO GO TO THE LOCAL WIFI AS WELL AS THE LINK TO GET ON THE NETWORK!


DOWNLOAD SKINS AND PUT THEM IN THE SKINS FOLDER TO ADD SKINS, AND FIND SKINS AT THE SKINS MUSEUM HERE:
