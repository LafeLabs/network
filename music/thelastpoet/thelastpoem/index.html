    WEBAMP is a JavaScript Library which brings back the magic of winamp!
    
    Winamp was the mp3 player of choice for a whole lot of the Napster generation, sharing music back in the 90s.
    
    I WAS THERE, GANDALF! I WAS THERE 3000 YEARS AGO!

        <h1>TRASH MAGIC MIX TAPE!</h1>
        
        <p>MUSICIANS! FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THE OWNERS OF THE RECORDING AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS HAVE TOLD YOU THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS THE BEST WAY FOR YOU TO BENEFIT FROM YOUR MUSIC!  WE PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION OF MUSIC IN WHICH TRASH MAGIC OPERATORS USE DONATED COMPUTERS WHICH ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN TO DISTRIBUTE MUSIC FOR FREE.  WE PROPOSE THAT THE FANS OF MUSIC SUPPORT MUSICIANS NOT BY "BUYING" THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO MUSIC BUT BY DIRECTLY PROVIDING SUPPORT TO MUSICIANS AS ARTISTS, SUPPORTING THE PERSON NOT THE WORK. THIS HOLDS FOR THE NETWORK OPERATORS AS WELL. WE ASK FOR SUPPORT AS CREATORS OF THE NETWORK, BUT THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ARE BOTH IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN!  THIS IS A FULLY ANARCHO-COMMUNIST NETWORK IN WHICH THE PHYSICAL NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. WE ARE BUILDING THE ANARCHIST BELL SYSTEM!</p>
        
        
        <P>WHAT WE ASK FOR FROM ARTISTS IS THAT YOU DONATE SONGS TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN SO THAT WE, THE TRASH MAGICIANS, CAN CREATE SELF-REPLICATING MIXTAPES WHICH USE THOSE SONGS!  SEND YOUR SONG OR A LINK TO YOUR SONG ALONG WITH A STATEMENT "I RELEASE THIS SONG INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN" TO THE OPERATOR AT OPERATOR@SLOANSLAKE.ART(REPLACE THIS WITH OTHER OPERATORS AS MORE OPERATORS JOIN THE NETWORK).  SEND AN ARTIST'S STATEMENT FOR YOUR GROUP OR YOURSELF ABOUT WHY AND HOW YOU MAKE ART.  SEND LINKS TO ALL YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA OR ANY OTHER CONTACT INFORMATION YOU WANT TO SHARE, LIKE EMAIL OR PHONE NUMBERS. SEND LINKS TO YOUR ACCOUNTS AT WHATEVER PAYMENT PLATFORM YOU HAVE LIKE CASHAPP VENMO, PAYPAL ETC. NO CRYPTO.  WE, THE OPERATORS, WILL MAKE YOU A TRASH MAGIC WEB PAGE WITH ALL YOUR INFORMATION AND THAT PAGE WILL SELF-REPLICATE AS PART OF THE SELF-REPLICATING MIXTAPE! </P>
        
        <P>
            ALSO SEND ANY OTHER ART YOU HAVE RELEVANT TO THE SONG AND ALSO A STATEMENT RELEASING THAT ART INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND IT WILL ALSO GET INTEGRATED INTO THE SELF-REPLICATING MIXTAPE AS PART OF YOUR TRASH MAGIC WEB PAGE!
        </P>
        
    
    <P>TRASH MAGIC WILL BUILD A SYSTEM OF SELF-REPLICATING MEDIA MADE OF TRASH WHICH IS USED TO CREATE SELF-REPLICATING REPLICATION TECHNOLOGY FROM TRASH WHICH REPLCIATES ALL THE THINGS WE NEED FOR A GOOD LIFE FROM TRASH AND THINGS WE CAN GROW!  AT THIS PHASE OF TRASH MAGIC WE USUALLY USE THE CAPS LOCK ALL THE TIME AND USUALLY END ALL OUR SENTENCES WITH EXCLAMATION MARKS AND ALSO MAKE SENTENCES THAT ARE TOO LONG!  WE WILL MAKE BILLIONS OF 4 INCH CARDBOARD SQUARES AND USE THEM TO BUILD UP AN INTERNET OF TRASH!  THIS INTERNET OF TRASH WILL SPREAD THE LINKS TO PUBLIC DOMAIN SERVERS FROM TRASH WHICH HOST THE TRASH MAGIC DOCUMENTS!  THIS IS HYPERTRASH, A SYSTEM OF HYPERLINKED MEDIA WHICH IS ALL FROM TRASH!  </P>
