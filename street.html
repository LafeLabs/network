    <h1>STREET NETWORK</h1>

<p>
The Street Network is the physical network which links all human constructions by means of transportation of people and things.  It consists of all the cities, roads, highways, trails, tunnels, parks, bridges, truck stops, bus stations, train stations, train tracks, paths, cities, neighborhoods, shopping centers and any other artificial common space.  This is not a network of private property but of public spaces.
