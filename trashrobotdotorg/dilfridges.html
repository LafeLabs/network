    <h1>Dilution Refrigerators</h1>

<p>
Is Quantum Winter coming?  When it does, how many fridges will get disposed of? How do we get those?  How can we find every single wasted old DR with a unit still working?  How can we get every mol of 3He that is out there in the waste stream into use again?  Can they all be placed on open source designed hardware built into waste-sourced dewars with waste-sourced cryopumps?
</p>

<p>Our aim in trash magic is to make everything from waste streams and deliver it freely to whoever can use it.  We want to find all the parts in the trash and then make a fully open and free quantum system which allows artists to freely experiment with all the quantum information technology.  This would be the Quantum Magic Dump.</p>
