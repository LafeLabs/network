    <h1>Trash Magic Flags</h1>

<p>
Trash Magic Flags are flags made from a solid color background and letters cut out from squares in a sequence of rainbow colors.  The font is simply removing as little from each square as possible( to use maximum trash) while clearly indicating the letter.  See image below for guide.
</p>

<p>flags can be used to either advertise a free product such as "free books" or "free web servers" or as a hyperlink to some domain which points to more trash magic servers, as shown below with the domain WWW.SLOANSLAKE.ART.  All caps are typical but not needed. By default, flags are about 3x3 feet and squares are 4 inches on a side</p>
