    <h1>FREE JOINTS!</h1>

<p>

This is Denver.  There are people here who trade weed for all kinds of services and people willing to do things for free.  Put these together and we get people with too much weed that they don't want that they got paid in.  We collect that and put it into joints and distribute those joints to anyone who is willing to meet up to expand the Trash Magic network.
