if you want any trash magic product and you're in denver, contact me on mastodon at @trashrobot@kolektiva.social and I will meet you at a local coffee shop and get you the goods!

If you're not in Denver, you might have to start your own node on the network, and start making the products and distributing them yourself.

Trash Magic Products:

The Geometron Hypercube is a 4 inch cube made of cardboard which can be used to store the art supplies you use to replicate the cube.   These tools include the box cutter, the sharpie, and the ruler.  The Geometron Hypercube is a self-replicating geometric construction from trash.  It is used to replicate the memes that we spread here in the virtual spaces of the trash magic network. These cubes can hold the Internet of Dirt, where they have dirt in them and people grow plants, and also the internet of mushrooms, where people put grow media in the cube and grow mushrooms on the cubes.  These cubes, like our trash magic web servers, form a new space that exists outside of the system of private property.  They are free!  We replicate them again and again and again.  And we use waste streams to generate the soil which goes in the cubes, and use living plants to split off cuttings to replicate the plants, making the whole system self-replicating.  

The Voice of the Slime is a synthesizer which is made entirely from trash.  The circuit board is trash. The enclosure is trash.  In theory we can get the parts from trash, but we ask for parts donations now from digikey orders.  One synthesizer uses about 1 dollar worth of parts.
